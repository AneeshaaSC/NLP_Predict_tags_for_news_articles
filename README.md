# NLP_Predict_tags_for_news_articles

Data - 

The file, available HERE (~50MB zipped), contains technology news articles from the Guardian newspaper, including their tags. The core of this challenge is to use the article body text to predict the document tags. While generally our work is not focused on NLP, we find this a fun dataset to experiment with.

What to do -

1.	What are the most common topics in the dataset?
2.	Which of these do you expect to be easiest to predict from the text?
3.	Which tags can be predicted best from the text?
4.	Is this according to your hypothesis? If not, can you speculate why?
